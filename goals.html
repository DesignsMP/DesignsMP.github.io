            <h2>My goals in pursing my bachelor's degrees.</h2>
            <p>For my remaining two years at K-State Polytechnic I will be pursuing both a bachelor's degree in Digital Media and Computer Systems Technology. This is due to both my interests in creative designs such as; a website redesign or a poster, and my new found interest in coding such as; developing web applications and back-end development projects.</p>
            
            <p>With my degrees I am still unsure what I wish to do as my career. With having two degrees it opens more doors as to what I can do as a career. For my junior and senior year I would like to experiment in different possible career paths until I find one that fits my personality and technical skills. </p>

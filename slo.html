            <h2> The K-State S.L.O's</h2>
            <p>The student learning outcomes set by K-State act as a checklist for all the skills one needs to achieve in order to graduation. Many assignments are directly linked to specific outcomes, while others may depend on the students approach to an assignment or project. This page will act as an Index to highlight which outcomes I have practiced and from which project I was able to work with them.</p>
            <h2>My take on Business Ethics</h2>
            <p>	Business ethics to me is to understand that there are numerous factors to consider when both accepting or working on a project. This includes, but is not limited to, conflicts of interest, handling personal information/ maintaining security, and thinking about possible consequences from certain actions whether by myself or another in the workplace. I also understand that when doing any kind of work, if its not original material, then those with ownership of the original material or were used as a major source of inspiration deserve credit. All sources need to be sited and certain pieces of material may require a license before legal use. Not only should a designer abide by their own ethics but they need to also follow the guidelines and rules set by the justice system. The final piece to how I view business ethics is, the job of the designer to help those with a vision achieve it through skills unpossessed by them. This should be done in a manner in which proper credit is given, a fair price is set, and no person, company, or any other form of being is harmed in the process.</p>
